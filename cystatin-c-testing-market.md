<p><h1>Cystatin C Testing Market Size, Growth and Forecast from 2025 - 2032</h1></p><p><strong>Cystatin C Testing Market Analysis and Latest Trends</strong></p>
<p><p>Cystatin C testing is a diagnostic method used to assess kidney function by measuring the levels of cystatin C, a protein produced by all nucleated cells in the body. Elevated levels of cystatin C can indicate impaired kidney function, making it a valuable biomarker for conditions such as chronic kidney disease (CKD) and acute kidney injury (AKI). As awareness of renal health increases and medical professionals seek more reliable biomarkers, the demand for cystatin C testing is on the rise.</p><p>The Cystatin C Testing Market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 7.6% during the forecast period. Factors driving this growth include the increasing prevalence of kidney-related disorders, advancements in laboratory testing technologies, and a growing emphasis on early diagnosis and prevention. Additionally, the integration of cystatin C testing into routine clinical practice and guidelines further supports market expansion. Trends indicate a shift towards point-of-care testing and increased use of cystatin C for monitoring treatment efficacy. As healthcare professionals increasingly recognize the limitations of traditional creatinine-based assessments, cystatin C testing is likely to become a standard practice, enhancing patient care and fostering market development.</p></p>
