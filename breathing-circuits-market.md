<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Breathing Circuits Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Open Breathing Circuits</li><li>Semi Open Breathing Circuits</li><li>Closed Breathing Circuits</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Breathing circuits are essential in healthcare for administering anesthesia and ventilatory support. Open breathing circuits allow exhaled gases to escape into the environment, ensuring minimal rebreathing but higher pollution. Semi-open circuits incorporate a reservoir bag, reducing exposure while still permitting some gas escape. Closed breathing circuits, often used in controlled environments, recycle exhaled gases, minimizing waste and improving efficiency. Each type varies in rebreathing risk, environmental impact, and application suitability, catering to different clinical scenarios and patient needs.</p></p>
