<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Heat Treated Glass Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Heat Stengthened Glass</li><li>Fully Tempered Glass</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The heat-treated glass market comprises two primary types: heat-strengthened glass and fully tempered glass. Heat-strengthened glass undergoes a controlled heating and cooling process that increases its strength and resistance to thermal stress, making it suitable for applications where safety and durability are important but not critical. Fully tempered glass, on the other hand, undergoes a more intense heating and cooling process, resulting in higher strength and resistance to impact. This type is commonly used in safety applications, such as facades and shower doors, where breaking could pose serious risks.</p></p>
