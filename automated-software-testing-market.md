<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automated Software Testing Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Static Testing</li><li>Dynamic Testing</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Automated software testing encompasses various market types, primarily static and dynamic testing. Static testing evaluates code without executing it, identifying issues early in the development process through techniques like code reviews and static analysis. In contrast, dynamic testing involves executing the code to validate its behavior and performance in real-time scenarios. This approach helps uncover runtime errors and ensures that the software meets functional requirements. Both types are essential for enhancing software quality and minimizing defects in the development lifecycle.</p></p>
